# Java-finalProject
Background:
I have taken pride in the assignments I have completed throughout the semester in my Intro to Java course at Arizona State University. I do not necessarily believe in posting these assignments on Github because they do not reflect my interests, but for the purpose of posting my first ever Repository I will make an exception here.  Of course I am always open to suggestion on how to improve on any of my posted programs. This can be suggestions on making the code more concise, errors in the logic, improving on the program’s functionality, etc…

Description of Program: 
This program is designed to allow the user to purchase seats at Gammage Theater. The program features a menu on startup that gives the user the option of displaying the current seating availability at Gammage Theater, the option of requesting tickets, and the option of displaying a theater sales report. When the user requests tickets he or she is prompted to input the desired number of seats, the desired row number, and the desired starting seat in said row. The user is displayed the price of the seats, and asked to input the amount he or she is paying. The tickets are printed along with a receipt displaying the change due. The available seating is updated, the total revenue is updated, and the total seats sold is updated.  The default seating availability, and the seating pricing per row, are opened and read from .txt files.
